# NOTES
# Implementation
#     Required API parameters
#         - To avoid runtime errors, required API parameters are not explicitly
#           enforced in the code. Instead, I found if qBittorrent returns HTTP400
#           without am error message, at least one required parameter is missing.
#           This raises a MissingRequiredParameters400 error.
#         - Alternatively, if a parameter is malformatted, HTTP400 is returned
#           with an error message.
#           This raises a InvalidRequest400 error.
#
#     Unauthorized HTTP 401
#         - This is only raised if XSS is detected or host header validation fails.
#
# API Peculiarities
#     app/setPreferences
#         - This was endlessly frustrating since it requires data in the
#           form of {'json': dumps({'dht': True})}...this way, Requests sends the
#           JSON dump as a key/value pair for "json" via x-www-form-urlencoded.
#         - Sending an empty string for 'banned_ips' drops the useless message
#           below in to the log file (same for WebUI):
#             ' is not a valid IP address and was rejected while applying the list of banned addresses.'
#             - [Resolved] https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent/issues/10745
#
#     torrents/downloadLimit and uploadLimit
#         - Hashes handling is non-standard. 404 is not returned for bad hashes and 'all' doesn't work.
#         - https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent/blob/6de02b0f2a79eeb4d7fb624c39a9f65ffe181d68/src/webui/api/torrentscontroller.cpp#L754  # noqa: E501
#         - https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent/issues/10744
#
#     torrents/info
#         - when using a GET request, the params (such as category) seemingly can't
#           contain spaces; however, POST does work with spaces.
#         - [Resolved] https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent/issues/10606

    Initialize API for qBittorrent client.

    Host must be specified. Username and password can be specified at login.
    A call to :meth:`~qbittorrentapi.auth.AuthAPIMixIn.auth_log_in` is not explicitly
    required if username and password are provided during Client construction.

    :Usage:
        >>> from qbittorrentapi import Client
        >>> client = Client(host='localhost:8080', username='admin', password='adminadmin')
        >>> torrents = client.torrents_info()

    :param host: hostname for qBittorrent Web API (e.g. [http[s]://]localhost[:8080])
    :param port: port number for qBittorrent Web API (note: only used if host does not contain a port)
    :param username: username for qBittorrent client
    :param password: password for qBittorrent client

    :param SIMPLE_RESPONSES: By default, complex objects are returned from some endpoints. These objects will allow for
        accessing responses' items as attributes and include methods for contextually relevant actions.
        This comes at the cost of performance. Generally, this cost isn't large; however, some
        endpoints, such as torrents_files() method, may need to convert a large payload.
        Set this to True to return the simple JSON back.
        Alternatively, set this to True only for an individual method call. For instance, when
        requesting the files for a torrent: client.torrents_files(hash='...', SIMPLE_RESPONSES=True).
    :param VERIFY_WEBUI_CERTIFICATE: Set to False to skip verify certificate for HTTPS connections;
        for instance, if the connection is using a self-signed certificate. Not setting this to False for self-signed
        certs will cause a APIConnectionError exception to be raised.
    :param EXTRA_HEADERS: Dictionary of HTTP Headers to include in all requests made to qBittorrent.
    :param REQUESTS_ARGS: Dictionary of configuration for Requests package: https://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/api/#requests.request
    :param FORCE_SCHEME_FROM_HOST: If a scheme (i.e. http or https) is specifed in host, it will be used regardless of
        whether qBittorrent is configured for HTTP or HTTPS communication. Normally, this client will attempt to
        determine which scheme qBittorrent is actually listening on...but this can cause problems in rare cases.
    :param RAISE_NOTIMPLEMENTEDERROR_FOR_UNIMPLEMENTED_API_ENDPOINTS: Some Endpoints may not be implemented in older
        versions of qBittorrent. Setting this to True will raise a NotImplementedError instead of just returning None.
    :param RAISE_ERROR_FOR_UNSUPPORTED_QBITTORRENT_VERSIONS: raise the UnsupportedQbittorrentVersion exception if the
        connected version of qBittorrent is not fully supported by this client.
    :param DISABLE_LOGGING_DEBUG_OUTPUT: Turn off debug output from logging for this package as well as Requests & urllib3.
